<p>A project to bring data analytics and machine learning to policy making.</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the natural limits of a city?</li>
<li>Is the city growing, stagnant or deflating?</li>
<li>How is the population changing? Is it organic through birth and death or through migration?</li>
<li>Is the change in demographic uniform? or Is it region bound? If it is region bound which region?</li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a id="service-planning-and-delivery" class="anchor" href="#service-planning-and-delivery" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Service planning and delivery</h1>

<ul>
<li>What are the current available services and delivery mechanism?</li>
<li>What are the additional service requirements?</li>
<li>Where are they required?</li>
<li>What are the future service requirements?</li>
<li>By when are they required?</li>
</ul>

<p>Lack of proper data on which to base the answer would lead to the decision maker deciding on the basis of his gut instinct.
Data driven policy is an initiative to explore public data analysis to facilitate informed decision making.</p>

<a id="data-collection-and-analysis" class="anchor" href="#data-collection-and-analysis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data collection and analysis.</h1>

<p>Mass data collection is a sensitive subject. On one hand it raises question of Big Brother peeping into the private life of citizens. On the other hand when all industries are moving towards data driven decision making to optimise their spending and revenue, it does not make sense for the government, the biggest spender of them all, to ignore available data for its decision making.</p>

<p>As a part of this project we will look at macro level data sets and use it to arrive at decisions related to improvement of the city.</p>

<p>Also check the wiki page at <a href="https://github.com/jahagirdar/Data-Driven-Policy/wiki">https://github.com/jahagirdar/Data-Driven-Policy/wiki</a> for topic specific analysis and potential data sources.</p>

<p>This project tries to identify various sources of data, their quality, and the prediction models that can be built using them.</p>

<p>This is an umbrella project which consist's of the following sub projects
In Progress</p>

<ul>
<li>Ananlysis of Bangalore voter demographics.</li>
<li>Analysis of BBMP Elections- candidates and results</li>
</ul>
