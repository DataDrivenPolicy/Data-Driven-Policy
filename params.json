Is it organic through birth and death or through migration?\r\n* Is the change in demographic uniform? or Is it region bound? If it is region bound which region?\r\n\r\n# Service planning and delivery\r\n\r\n* What are the current available services and delivery mechanism?\r\n* What are the additional service requirements?\r\n* Where are they required?\r\n* What are the future service requirements?\r\n* By when are they required?\r\n\r\nLack of proper data on which to base the answer would lead to the decision maker deciding on the basis of his gut instinct.\r\nData driven policy is an initiative to explore public data analysis to facilitate informed decision making.\r\n\r\n# Data collection and analysis.\r\n\r\nMass data collection is a sensitive subject. On one hand it raises question of Big Brother peeping into the private life of citizens. On the other hand when all industries are moving towards data driven decision making to optimise their spending and revenue, it does not make sense for the government, the biggest spender of them all, to ignore available data for its decision making.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this project we will look at macro level data sets and use it to arrive at decisions related to improvement of the city.\r\n\r\nAlso check the wiki page at https://github.com/jahagirdar/Data-Driven-Policy/wiki for topic specific analysis and potential data sources.\r\n\r\nThis project tries to identify various sources of data, their quality, and the prediction models that can be built using them.\r\n\r\nThis is an umbrella project which consist's of the following sub projects\r\nIn Progress\r\n* Ananlysis of Bangalore voter demographics.\r\n* Analysis of BBMP Elections- candidates and results\r\n\r\nThe reports of these projects can be found at http://rpubs.com/vijayvithal\r\n\r\nThe Code for these projects are at https://github.com/jahagirdar/elections\r\nPlanned\r\n* Analysis of BBMP Projects\r\n* Analysis of BBMP Income expenditure statuements.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
