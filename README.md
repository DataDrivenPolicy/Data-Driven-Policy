# municipal-learning
A project to bring data analytics and machine learning to municipal projects.

* What are the natural limits of a city?
* Is the city growing, stagnant or deflating?
* How is the population changing? Is it organic through birth and death or through migration?
* Is the change in demographic uniform? or Is it region bound? If it is region bound which region?

# Service planning and delivery

* What are the current available services and delivery mechanism?
* What are the additional service requirements?
* Where are they required?
* What are the future service requirements?
* By when are they required?

# Data collection and analysis.
Mass data collection is a sensitive subject. On one hand it raises question of Big Brother peeping into the private life of citizens. On the other hand when all industries are moving towards data driven decision making, It is ridiculous for our Neta's and Babu's to make decisions based on gut feel or squeaky wheel.

This project tries to identify various sources of data, their quality, and the prediction models that can be built using them.

# Sub Project

* Analysis of BBMP Projects
* Analysis of BBMP Income and expenditure data
